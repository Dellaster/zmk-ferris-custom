Yet another ZMK Ferris Sweep Bling config I'm testing out. Work in progress. Custom layout is flipped and tweaked from an HIEAMTSRN starting point (https://www.keyboard-design.com/letterlayout.html?layout=hieamtsrn.en.ansi). Heavily weighted to the bottom row instead of top because I'm learning in preparation for buying a Svalboard, which favors south characters over north ones. And, contrary to the common opinion, my fingers seem to prefer the curl downwards.

Stats calculated at https://cyanophage.github.io/table.html by editing one of the existing layouts to match as best as possible what I had in mind:

High inward rolls, high alternations, and pretty decent everywhere else.

These two web tools are a great help:
