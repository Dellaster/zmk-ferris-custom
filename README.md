Yet another ZMK Ferris Sweep Bling config I'm testing out. Work in progress. Custom layout is flipped and tweaked from a HIEAMTSRN & BALANCE 12 starting point. Heavily weighted to the bottom row instead of top because I'm learning in preparation for getting a Svalboard, which favors south characters over north ones.

Stats calculated at https://cyanophage.github.io/table.html by editing one of the existing layouts to match as best as possible what I had in mind:

High inward rolls, high alternations, and pretty decent everywhere else.

These two web tools are a great help:
