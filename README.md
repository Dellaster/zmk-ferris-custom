Yet another ZMK Ferris Sweep Bling config I'm testing out. Work in progress. Layout is Arno's Engram.

Alpha layer is good to go for typing practice; the other layers are simplified and preliminary. Note that the right and left layers are identical so that all the extra keys can be used from either right or left outer thumb keys, whichever is more comfortable, similar to how left and right shift keys work on a normal keyboard. This way you can hold the layer key *and* home row shift key for the opposite side's shifted keys. Speaking of shift keys, the thumb labeled "shiftdance" is a sticky shift if tapped once, Caps Word if tapped twice.

There are three tap dances that include Mod Morphs:

     comma dance -- tap for comma, double-tap for semicolon, asterisk when shifted
 
     dot dance   -- tap for dot, double-tap for colon, hash when shifted
 
     ques dance  -- tap for question mark, double-tap for forward slash, exclamation when shifted
     
There are also two simple tap dances:

     dash dance  -- tap for minus, double-tap for plus, underline when shifted
 
     shift dance -- tap for dot, double-tap for colon, hash when shifted
     
These two web tools are a great help:
