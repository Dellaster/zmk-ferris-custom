Yet another ZMK Ferris Sweep Bling config I'm testing out. Work in progress. Layout is Hands-Down Vibranium (Neu-vv).

Alpha layer is good to go for typing practice; the other layers are simplified and preliminary. Note that the right and left layers are identical so that all the extra keys can be used from either right or left outer thumb keys, whichever is more comfortable, similar to how left and right shift keys work on a normal keyboard. This way you can hold the layer key *and* home row shift key for the opposite side's shifted keys.
